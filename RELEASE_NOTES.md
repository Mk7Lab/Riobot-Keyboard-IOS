# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches, though, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.


## Older release notes

Older versions have their release notes listed in the `Release_Notes` folder.



## 7.3

### üëë Pro changes

* `LicenseTier` has removed the `kk` name prefix and the `com.keyboardkit.` ID prefix.



## 7.2

This version focuses on making it easier to style keyboards.

This version adds a theme engine to KeyboardKit Pro. The new `KeyboardThemeAppearance` can be used with the new `KeyboardTheme` to style keyboards with themes, which is a lot easier than defining custom appearances.

This version comes with three themes - `.cottonCandy`, `.neonNights` and `.tron`. You can use them in your own keyboads, or tweak them to create your own visual styles. More themes are coming in future versions. 

Due to a bug found in the new autocomplete provider, the old `StandardAutocompleteProvider` will be replaced in the next minor version.

### ‚ú® New features

* `AutocompleteContext` has a new `isEnabled` property that can be used to disable autocomplete.
* `KeyboardAppearance` has a new `autocompleteToolbarStyle` property.
* `KeyboardAppearance` has a new `keyboardBackground` property.
* `KeyboardBackgroundStyle` is a new style that can be used to the background of a keyboard.
* `KeyboardButtonStyle` properties are now optional to allow for overrides.
* `KeyboardButtonStyle` has a new `pressedOverlayColor` property that can be used to highlight buttons.
* `KeyboardButtonStyle` has a new `extended(with:)` function to let you extend a style with another style.
* `View+SystemKeyboardButton` has a new `isPressed` parameter to let you define pressed state.

### üëë Pro changes

* `KeyboardInputViewController` will use the new autocomplete context property to disable autocomplete if needed.

* `ActionCalloutStyle` has been renamed to `KeyboardActionCalloutStyle`.
* `InputCalloutStyle` has been renamed to `KeyboardInputCalloutStyle`.



## 7.1.3

This version adds an `isKeyboardFloating` property to the keyboard context. It's currently not used to change the visual representation of floating keyboards, but please verify that it works as expected.

### ‚ú® New features

* `KeyboardContext` has a new `isKeyboardFloating` property that can be used to determine if the keyboard is floating.



## 7.1.2

### üí° Behavior changes

* `GestureButtonDefaults` have adjusted `repeatDelay` to `0.5`.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `KeyboardLayoutConfiguration` now applies Pro Max configuration to iPhone 14 Pro Max.
* `SystemKeyboard` will now show autocomplete in Twitter and Mastodon.
* `View+KeyboardGestures` will now trigger repeating actions like backspace more like the native keyboards.



## 7.1.1

This version fixes some bugs in `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` and tweaks their behavior a bit.

The demo app has a new `KeyboardTextInput` demo keyboard that shows `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` in action. 

### ‚ú® New features

* `KeyboardInputView` is a new protocol that lets you apply a `focused` binding together with a custom done button.

### üí° Behavior changes

* `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` now implement the new `KeyboardInputView` protocol.
* `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` now apply a basic style before applying any custom configuration.
* `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` now animates together with the focused state.
* `KeyboardTextField` now applies a background color and border style.
* `KeyboardTextView` now applies a background color, corner radius and font.
* `KeyboardTextView` now uses the same font as `KeyboardTextField` by default.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` now correctly resigns as first responder when they lose focus.



## 7.1

This version fixes some bugs and makes it even easier to setup KeyboardKit.

KeyboardKit Pro also has a new experimental and much better autocomplete provider that you can toggle on with the `FeatureToggle`:

```swift
FeatureToggle.shared.toggleFeature(.newAutocompleteEngine, .on)
```

Once this has been verified to work better than the current provider, it will replace it and this feature toggle flag will be removed.

Furthermore, the locale context menu has been refactored to work and look a lot better on iOS 16 and macOS 12. This unfortunately required a few breaking api changes, that hopefully will not affect anyone.

### ‚ú® New features

* `FeatureToggle` has a new `.newAutocompleteEngine` feature.
* `KeyboardContext` has a new `localePresentationLocale` property.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` has new `setup` functions that provide a view builder with an unowned controller reference.
* `QuotationAnalyzer` has more functions.
* `String` has new quotation functions.

### üëë Pro changes

* KeyboardKit Pro has a new experimental autocomplete provider that can be toggled on to replace the standard one.
* Many iPad layouts have been tweaked to look even closer to the native layouts.

### üí° Behavior changes

* `KeyboardInputViewController` `setup` uses a view builder instead of a static view.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` now calls `viewWillSetupKeyboard` in `viewWillAppear` instead of `viewDidLoad`.
* `KeyboardRootView` uses a view builder instead of a static view. 

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `iPadKeyboardLayoutProvider` had a line accidentally removed, which caused English layouts to render incorrect. This has been fixed.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` now creates the keyboard view later, which makes it respect the safe areas better in landscape.
* `LocaleContextMenu` now uses the `KeyboardContext` to localize and sort locales. 

### üí• Breaking changes 

* `SpaceLongPressBehavior` cases have been renamed to read better. This should hopefully affect few people.



## 7.0

KeyboardKit 7.0 involves a major rewrite that aims to bring more consistency in naming and structure and to streamline the library to make future development easier. It bumps the platform deployment targets to iOS 14, macOS 11, tvOS 14 and watchOS 7 and removes all previously deprecated code and todos.

### Migrating from KeyboardKit 6

Although KeyboardKit 7.0 aims to introduce as few breaking changes as possible, there are some surface level APIs that will change. Some such changes are the removal of many shared instances and how more dependencies have to be passed in as parameters. If you are using the now removed shared instances, simply inject the instance as initializer or function parameter instead. 

KeyboardKit 7.0 makes the `SystemKeyboard` easier to use, where it now adds an autocomplete toolbar by default to make sure that the callouts has enough space, and to reduce the risk of memory leaks that was previously easy to add by accident when you connected the toolbar to the keyboard input controller's autocomplete function. If your keyboard uses a custom autocomplete toolbar, you must pass in `autocompleteToolbar: none` in the system keyboard initializer.

If you have problems upgrading to `7.0`, first try upgrading to `6.9`. It has a lot of deprecations in place to provide guidance. You may still experience breaking changes after that, but they will be fewer.
